# Alzheimer's Dataset Analysis

This repository contains my work on an Alzheimer's dataset, focusing on data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization to explore patterns and insights related to the disease.

## Key Features:
- *Data Preprocessing*: Cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing data for better usability.  
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Identifying trends, correlations, and patterns in the dataset.  
- *Visualizations*: Graphs and charts to illustrate key findings.  
- *Tools Used*: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, JupyterÂ Notebook.
